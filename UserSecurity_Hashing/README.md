# UserSecurity_Hashing

## In this project it checks if the user has an account which won't allow him to see the secret message. BUT! If he is registerd, (which I made it for the user to be able to if the submit button is clicked twice) the secret message will be displayed as long as the users password in hashed format.

                       Whats in the files!?
    First, under the models folder, in user.php
    two quick functions were included in order to return for successful retrieval of the hashed password.
	For more information over hash functions:

    }
    In the scripts.js file, some basic javascript was implemented to get the start up going.
    Also a users.sql file is included to be imported in phpMyAdmin database
